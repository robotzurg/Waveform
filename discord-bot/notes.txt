And yet, here Jaron is, taking his crack at creating the ultimate song experience that truly culminates all of his skill in music making.\n\nAnd he did it.\n\nHe knocked it out of the PARK.\n\nThis is one of the most unique experiences I've listened to across all of my time listening to EDM, a song that never quite drops and yet continually builds and flows upon itself in a way that only an artist like Jaron could create.\n\nIs it the kind of song you'd listen to on your own? No, probably not. But as Jarons only release of 2021, and as what many could even consider the magnum opus of his entire career?\n\nHe absolutely did it. Welcome back Jaron. We missed you.",

This song just feels like everything Jaron has done in his career has built up to this masterpiece of a song. I feel like this is his magnum opus. The length of the song might scare some away but it does everything it possibly can and more with the 11 minutes. There are no flashy drops and yet the emotion stays rising and building the entire 11 minutes. The vocal chops used in this are just stunning and the sound design is changing throughout making the song stay interesting. The 2nd half of this song especially just gives me chills the entire time.

It may not have the most saves of any album I have heard and it may not have my #1 song of all time on it, but the way this album is put together is masterfully crafted and just one of the best album listening experiences you will ever have. Jaron has always been an artist with pretty hard hitting and impactful tunes, this album strays away from that a bit and goes full creativity mode and its the best Jaron has ever been. You can just hear the passion and creativity flow through this entire album. Its not a perfect album, but its a perfect experience. Most deserving album for the title of masterpiece in my opinion.",
